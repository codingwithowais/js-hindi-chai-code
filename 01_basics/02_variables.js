const id = 125466;
let city = "Lucknow";
var state = "UP";

city = "Kanpur";
state = "MP";

// We can not update id as it is constant

// city and state can be updated but let and var differ

// let is a block scope element whereas var is not

// It is always a best practice to use const and let due to issue of var in 
// block scope and functional scope
